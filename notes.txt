TODO:
- Remove --noseedbackup from start-lnd.sh
- Frontend should attempt reconnecting?
- LndStore socket url should be specifiable via env var?





Remove all untagged images:
- docker rmi $(docker images | grep "^<none>" | awk "{print $3}")




Things learned:

- Google Cloud Build, Run, Registry
- Basic Koa server
- Docker compose file
- Basic testnet lightning payment
- Bash PS1 no-length characters



Things I still don't understand

- A Dockerfile is for building an image _and_ running a container?? It seems
  overloaded with "install" steps but also typically ending with a command
  (CMD). This is confusing.
- Are some build steps being duplicated when building and running?
- When running `yarn install --production`, why must my `package.json` have
  dependencies that are only necessary for building (like "moment") under
  `dependencies` rather than `devDepencencies`? Or does it not? Could do
  `yarn install` without `--production` but then that defeats the purpose of
  their separation in `package.json`

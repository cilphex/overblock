# 5. Wrapping up

We're ready to go!

Once you have all of the services up and running at the same time, you can
visit the app in the browser and play around with it. Try selecting a product
and making a Lightning **testnet** payment to the QR code. If everything's
working as expected, you should see a success view.

Keep in mind:

- `btcd` should be fully synced first
- This is all testnet, not mainnet (unless you changed the configs)
